We're gonna destroy them together.", " Everyone breaks, Elias!", " Shit, son.", " You know our laws, son. You fail to protect your brothers...you join them in death.", " I am Gabriel Rorke. I have been trained by your Government to be a weapon. Trained to kill and destroy. All in the name of Liberty and Justice. Even surrender my very life in service to your country. But I am not one of you. The \"Just\" have turned their backs and become deaf to your cries. Who, then will show them justice? Who will show you the Liberty they have promised? The weapon they have created will be their undoing. But do not fear this. Do not fear me. It is only natural. Like the collapse of Rome, your cities will crumble and there will be great sorrow. But from the ashes of this diseased metropolis, a rebirth will occur. It will be paid for in blood and steel. Liberty must be restored.

    1: [" The healthy human mind doesn't wake up in the morning thinking that this is its last day on earth. But I think that's a luxury, not a curse. Knowing you're close to the end is a kind of freedom. Good time to take... inventory. Outgunned. Outnumbered. Out of our minds. On a suicide mission. But the sand and rocks here stained with thousands of years of warfare, they will remember us. For this. Because out of all our vast array of nightmares, this is the one we choose for ourselves.

Let's top these bastards before they kill the old man.", " Why'd you do it? Where did you get the bomb?", " Zakhaev's son, commander of the Ultranationalist forces in the field. Rotten apple doesn't fall far from the tree. The Loyalist, Kamarov, has got a location on the kid.", " They've started a bloody countdown! Zakhaev's gonna launch the remaining missiles!", " Well at least the world didn't end. Hit it.", " Roger that Soap. I've found Roach. He appears to be intact.", " Do NOT trust Shepherd- I say again, DO NOT TRUST SHEPHERD! Soap! GET DOWN!", " Makarov wouldn't let this travel lightly if it didn't serve a greater purpose, and chances are the bastard will be there personally to see things off. If he's back on the grid...then so are we", " Soap TRUSTED you. I thought I could too. So WHY, IN BLOODY HELL, DOES MAKAROV KNOW YOU?!", " We're gonna have one shot to grab the President before he gives up the launch codes and Makarov turns Europe into glass.

But he comes to first, BOOM! Welcome to the Hanoi Hilton. Six months later, they shipped me over to Da Nang. And this fucking place made the Hilton look good. We lost 17 in my group. By '72, it was just me. I was not gonna die in a FUCKING SWAMP!!", "Thanks to your old man. He put it all on the line for me... for honor... and friendship."],

    4: ["You did it, Mason! You did what I could not!", "The men and I had fought through the most bitter of winters on the Eastern Front, but we were no strangers to the cold. Even now, the blood in my veins chills when I think back to the events of that day... Far, far from home...", "Today, my comrades... Vorkuta... BURNS!!!", "Die like the RATS you are"],
    5: ["I'd given up hope of ever gettin' out. But Viktor Reznov found a way.", "It's Weaver. He's burnt.", "You should have stayed in Vorkuta.", "Woods! You look like hammered shit!", "How many times?! Steiner was at Rebirth Island! We had to kill Steiner!", "I remember...Ahhhh! Vorkuta...", "Where am I? Where's Reznov?", "My name is Viktor Reznov, and I will have my revenge!", "Your evil has claimed the lives of many good men!

He'd do it for me.", "Turns out you're a lousy shot.", "I made the mistake of not confirming the kill five years ago at Baikonur.", "It's all in your mind, Woods."],
    6: ["Reznov's dead, Mason! Do you hear me!? HE'S DEAD!", "Jason Hudson, CIA. We're here to talk about your encounter with Russians in Laos.

This is what your greed has brought you.", "All warfare is based on deception. For years, the West's hypocrisy has made the world a battlefield. The corrupt talk; while our brothers and sons spill their own blood. But deceit cuts both ways. The bigger the lie, the more likely people will believe it, and when a nation cries for vengeance, the lie spreads like a wildfire. The fire builds, devouring everything in its path.

How long did it take him to die?", "I've destroyed your world piece by piece. It's only a matter of time until I find you."],
    8 : ["Today we reshape the world. Our motherland is lead by cowards and weaklings. In time, the Americans and their NATO puppets will bring the Soviet Union to its knees. We will break the stalemate, then burn them both to the ground. They sleep soundly at night, knowing they put on a good parade - but they lack the will to do what must be done. The superpowers will fall, victims of their own greed and corruption. We will rebuild Greater Russia from the ashes.", "Comrades, the United States and its allies have slowly consumed that which is dear to us. Our leaders continue to weaken under this threat. It is the MORAL duty of `Perseus` to act when they will not. Soon we will possess an American Nuclear Bomb, the key to unlock their entire Greenlight arsenal.
